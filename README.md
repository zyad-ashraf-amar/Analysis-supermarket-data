# Analysis of Supermarket Data

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides an in-depth analysis of supermarket transaction data. Using the Apriori algorithm, the notebook extracts association rules to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior. It includes data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

## Features

1. **Implementation of the Apriori Algorithm**  
   - Calls a custom or library-defined function for rule extraction.
   - Generates insights into the association between items.

2. **Data Reading and Preparation**  
   - Loads the supermarket dataset.
   - Cleans and organizes the data for analysis.

3. **Transaction Analysis**  
   - Processes raw data into transactional format.
   - Prepares datasets suitable for Apriori-based mining.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Includes visualizations for:
     - Transaction distributions.
     - Relationships between items.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `mlxtend` (or equivalent for Apriori algorithm)

---

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Run the cells sequentially for complete analysis.
